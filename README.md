**My DCA Praparation**

  - DCA – Certification Overview – https://success.docker.com/certification
  - Syllabus is available in Study Guide by Docker - https://docker.cdn.prismic.io/docker%2Fa2d454ff-b2eb-4e9f-af0e-533759119eee_dca+study+guide+v1.0.1.pdf

**How I learned/prepared**
- Learned Docker using the ‘Docker Mastery’ course by Bret Fisher - https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/. I recommend this to every Docker student. I am now (Post certification) doing the docker and Kubernetes course by Stephen Grider which is also a good course as far as I have completed.
- For hands-on experience, use https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
- Read the official Docker documentation on basic commands, swarm and service. https://docs.docker.com/
- Read the links in this repo to understand the core concepts - https://github.com/Evalle/DCA

**Exam Experience**

The exam started with a Goto meeting and the proctor helped me do the setup and was available for help throughout the test. Each question can be answered and also flagged for later review. I was able to finish the exam within 50 minutes and faced no technical issue/glitch.

**Exam content**

Exam is of average difficulty level for a well prepared student. There are 30% of questions which are very straight forward, 20% of questions (I mean, Answer options) are very tricky which will confuse you. The rest of the questions are of average complexity/difficulty which are no cake walk but no mountain trek as well.

**The result**

Once I answered all the questions and reviewd the flagged ones, I was quite unsure of the result because Docker does not reveal the score required to pass the exam and I did not really feel confident about the result (Thanks to those tricky questions and couple of questions which I did not know the answer). Anyway, the result 'PASS' was presented immediately after I submitted the answers and later the section wise performance report was sent to my email.  I did the claculation and my score is 85%.
